# Plan for this Week:
- Refresh C++
- Planning out the next semester

### Imposter Syndrome: 

As it stands, I have one semester left in my masters program and so far I feel like a lot of what I learned never really stuck. Therefore, I want to start off this week by going back to the basics and refreshing on C++ (considering I also have a C++ class next semester). 

## Jan. 2nd
- Birthday!

Today was my birthday and had some free time so I started to watch this course from [Bro Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TkoO8Z07hI). My goal is to watch this video and refresh on the very basic with C++. What I really want to do is at least post something everyday even if its a minor update, the goal is to be consitent. 

## Jan. 3rd

Started actually writing out the very basics of a program. The main goal is to focus on: 

    - Input and Output CLI
    - Functions
    - Constants and Type Aliases
    - Arithmetic Operations and Type Conversions
    - Commom math Operations

I started building a console-based mini test bench, and I got the idea from asking ChatGPT about what projects to build. However I think for the next project I might have to make it more clear with what it wants. 

```
===============================
Welcome to the mini test bench!
Please Enter Voltage (V): 
1.2
Please Enter Current (A): 
12
Please Enter Resistance (Ω) : 
200
Please Enter 2nd Voltage (V): 
1.22
===============================
```

Here is the beginning of it. Very basic, but it is starting to come back. 


# Next Week:
- Still don't know
