# Plan for this Week:
- Refresh C++
- Planning out the next semester

## Imposter Syndrome: 

As it stands, I have one semester left in my masters program and so far I feel like a lot of what I learned never really stuck. Therefore, I want to start off this week by going back to the basics and refreshing on C++ (considering I also have a C++ class next semester). 

# Next Week:
- Still don't know
