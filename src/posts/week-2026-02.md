# What I Built This Week:

- Built a simple LED blinker circuit on breadboard
- Wrote bare-metal code to toggle GPIO pins
- Created a PWM dimmer for smooth LED fading
- Debugged timing issues with an oscilloscope

# Technical Details:

The hardest part was getting the timing right. Initially, my LED was blinking way too fast because I miscalculated the clock divider:

```c
// Wrong - blinks at 1MHz!
GPIO_TOGGLE(LED_PIN);
delay(1);

// Right - blinks at 1Hz
GPIO_TOGGLE(LED_PIN);
delay(1000);
```

For the PWM dimmer, I used a simple duty cycle approach:

```c
void pwm_fade(uint8_t brightness) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
        if (i < brightness) {
            GPIO_HIGH(LED_PIN);
        } else {
            GPIO_LOW(LED_PIN);
        }
        delay_us(100);
    }
}
```

# What I Learned:

- **GPIO registers** are just memory-mapped I/O
- **Pull-up resistors** prevent floating pins
- **Debouncing** is critical for button inputs
- Reading datasheets is 80% of embedded development

# Challenges:

The biggest challenge was understanding **why my LED wasn't lighting up**. Turns out:
1. I had the polarity backwards (classic mistake)
2. Forgot the current-limiting resistor
3. Ground wasn't connected properly

After fixing these rookie mistakes, everything worked perfectly!

# Next Week:

- Implement UART serial communication
- Set up interrupts for button handling
- Start working on a simple state machine
- Maybe add an LCD display?
